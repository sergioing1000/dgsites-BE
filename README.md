# Wind Data API with FastAPI 🚀

This project is a FastAPI-based backend that fetches wind speed and direction data from NASA POWER API for a given location and date range, generates polar charts and an Excel file with the results, and provides endpoints to download the generated files.

## Features

✅ Fetches daily wind data (speed and direction) from NASA POWER API  
✅ Generates:
- Daily Wind Scatter Polar Chart
- Wind Rose Bar Chart
- Monthly Summary Polar Chart

✅ Exports the data and charts into an Excel file  
✅ Serves the Excel file through a download endpoint  
✅ CORS configuration for local and production environments
